# 🌿 Leafline
<p>Leafline is the modern cannabis discovery platform built for patients, by patients. We’re redefining how people find, explore, and connect with dispensaries and cannabis products — starting right here in Oklahoma.</p>
<br/>
<h2>🚀 Why Leafline?</h2>
<p>While platforms like Weedmaps and Leafly helped pioneer cannabis discovery, they've become bloated, outdated, and disconnected from the communities they serve. Leafline is here to fix that.</p>
<br/>
<p>✅ Built for the Patient Experience</p>
<p>We prioritize clarity, speed, and trust. No endless popups, ads, or fake menus — just clean, accurate listings and real-time availability.</p>
<p>✅ Local First</p>
<p>Leafline is launching hyper-locally, starting in Oklahoma City & Edmond, with direct relationships to dispensaries. We’re not a corporate directory — we’re your local plug, modernized.</p>
<p>✅ Clean UX & Mobile-First Design</p>
<p>Weedmaps and Leafly feel like 2014. Leafline was built from the ground up with a mobile-first, minimalist interface that doesn’t make users dig through clutter to find what they need.</p>
<p>✅ Real-Time, Verified Menus</p>
<p>Dispensaries on Leafline get tools to instantly update their menus. No third-party sync delays. No ghost inventory. What you see is what’s in stock.</p>
<p>✅ Transparent Reviews & No Pay-to-Play</p>
<p>Tired of seeing paid placements masquerading as “top picks”? Leafline is ad-free by default — our goal is relevance, not revenue off of manipulation.</p>
